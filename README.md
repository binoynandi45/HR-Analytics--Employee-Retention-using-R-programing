What is the probability of attrition in call centers in Bangalore?

Objective:
Company X operates several call centres in Bangalore and there are very high attrition numbers in these call centres. That is, the attrition rates in these call centres can be as high as 70 â€“ 80% across a single year. This causes major staffing issues and workflow problems. The problem is identifying the likelihood a person will leave, when the person is hired, and what are the key attributes of employees who attrite.

Suggested Approach:
  
Since the idea is to determine the probability of people attriting from Company X, the best way to do so would be through a logistic regression. This will help determine who are the employee profiles most likely to depart from the organization and if so when. It would help in using this model during recruitment so that major red flag employees are not hired and Company X hires call centre operators who stay for longer.
